Hi, I'm Fergal.

# Who Am I And What Do I Do?

I'm the Data Engineering Lead for Xanadu Consultancy. I work primarily in Python, R, SQL and Spark to help build performant, resilient and maintainable data processes. I'm also used to getting stuck in at the infrastructure and deployment layer and helping stakeholders from across the business translate their needs into data solutions.

# And Outside the Office?

I'm a pretty big tech enthusiast. I'm usually tinkering with some side project (As I write, it's a small library to help remove unneeded dynamic polymorphism in Rust projects). Most of these side projects start with me realising I don't know how something works and end with me realising I still don't know how it works, but that the part I don't understand is now one layer deeper into the tech stack. And so the cycle repeats.
